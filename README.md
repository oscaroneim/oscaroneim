# _Welcome_ ðŸ–– Â 
Iâ€™m Oscar, skateboarder turned aspiring full-stack developer andÂ a big fan of all things tech. My main language is Javascript but I've dabbled in Ruby, Solidity and SQL. I attended an intense bootcamp in 2024 called The School of Code that teaches you the importance of soft skills as well as how to code. Feel free to get in touch and ask me questions about the course or what I'm up to.
