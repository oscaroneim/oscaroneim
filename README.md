# _Welcome_ ðŸ––ðŸ¤“ Â 


This is my personal repository that will host all my projects and contributions. Im starting a journey to become a software engineer with the School of Code **https://www.schoolofcode.co.uk/** which is a 4 month bootcamp based in the UK. This repo will be updated as I go along, documenting my progress on what I've learned so far and whats coming next. Feel free to follow along and watch my progress. Also reach out to me if ever you have questions or ideas you want to talk about. Im always open to new things.
