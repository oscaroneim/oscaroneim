# _Welcome_ ðŸ––ðŸ¤“ Â 
Iâ€™m Oscar, skateboarder turned aspiring full-stack developer andÂ a big fan of all things tech. My main language is Javascript but I've dabbled in Ruby, Solidity and SQL. I'm currently working my way through The School of Code bootcamp that teaches you how to be job ready for the industry. Feel free to get in touch and ask me questions about the course or what I'm up to.
