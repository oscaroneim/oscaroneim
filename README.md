# _Oscars repo_ 

Welcome to my personal repo. Here you'll find all types of repositories ranging from my personal work to group foucused projects. My main languages are Javascript/TypeScript but I've also worked with Ruby SQL and Solidity. The styling in my repositories are a mix of CSS and Tailwind. Currently I have one real world project with a small business called Fauna Green Living. The stakeholders problem was that her website needed a complete re-work including a new and imporved stock management system, SEO optimisation and a fresh UI to accurately represent the stakeholders ideals and mission statemanet. All of this had to be completed in 4 weeks which ended up being a great success with one very happy stakeholder. So far I'm loving the journey and I cant wait to add more projects to my name. Feel free to reach out at any time and Im happy to share any kmowledge about my School of Code experiance.
