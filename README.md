# _Welcome_ ðŸ––ðŸ¤“ Â 


Iâ€™m Oscar, aÂ crusty skateboarder turned aspiring software engineer, andÂ a big fan of all things tech.
When I was young, I was fascinated by gaming. I would spend hours a day playing all types, from 2d side scrollers to earliest pc games to the latest console games. This loved turned into a larger interest in technology. During the 2000â€™s I had a brief encounter with CSS thanks to myspace which left a mark on me and ever since then I have always been curious about code. It wasnâ€™t until 2020 when I decided that it was time that I give coding a proper go. Since then Iâ€™ve fallen in love with it and practiced as a hobby. What got me hooked was the feeling you get from fixing something and seeing the green â€˜passâ€™ in the terminal or when build something and it actually works. In 2023 I started to feel like my life wasnâ€™t moving forward and I decided to turn my hobby into career. At work, a colleague and I started to talk about what I doing in my spare time and amazingly enough, she was an alumni from the School of Code and suggested I apply. After a few minutes of talking, I knew that the school of code was exactly what I was looking for. Literally 3 days later I had applied for the course and fast forward to today and Iâ€™m 2 months into the course!

 
School of Code is an intensive 16-week course that covers frontend engineering, Backend engineering, DevOps, cyber security, Quality assurance, product design, computational thinking, mindset guides and even the Agile approach. As you can see there is a lot on my plate but I have loved every second of it and canâ€™t wait to see what Iâ€™m working on a few months from now.
